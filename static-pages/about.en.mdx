## STATION PHILOSOPHY

Amateur radio for me is not just a hobby, but a way to explore the world through radio waves. Each QSO is a bridge between people, cultures, and technologies.

I am particularly fascinated by modern digital communication modes and SDR technologies, which open new horizons in radio communication and allow for signal experimentation.
