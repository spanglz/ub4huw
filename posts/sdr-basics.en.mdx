Software Defined Radio (SDR) has revolutionized the world of radio communication, making complex radio engineering experiments accessible to every radio amateur.

## What is SDR?

SDR is a radio system where components traditionally implemented in hardware (mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented in software on a personal computer or embedded system.

### Key Advantages of SDR:

- **Flexibility**: One device can operate in various modes
- **Upgradability**: New features are added through software updates
- **Cost**: Significantly cheaper than traditional solutions
- **Education**: An excellent tool for learning radio engineering

## Popular SDR Devices

### RTL-SDR (~$25)
The most affordable solution for beginners. Based on the RTL2832U chip.

**Specifications:**
- Frequency Range: 24 MHz - 1766 MHz
- Bandwidth: up to 3.2 MHz
- ADC Resolution: 8-bit
- Operating Mode: Receive only

### HackRF One (~$300)
A half-duplex SDR device with transmit capability.

**Specifications:**
- Frequency Range: 1 MHz - 6 GHz
- Bandwidth: up to 20 MHz
- ADC Resolution: 8-bit
- Operating Mode: Transmit/Receive (half-duplex)

### USRP B200 (~$700)
A professional solution from Ettus Research.

**Specifications:**
- Frequency Range: 70 MHz - 6 GHz
- Bandwidth: up to 56 MHz
- ADC Resolution: 12-bit
- Operating Mode: Full-duplex

## Software

### GNU Radio
A powerful development environment for SDR applications.

\`\`\`python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from gnuradio import gr, blocks, analog
from gnuradio import audio

class fm_receiver(gr.top_block):
  def __init__(self):
      gr.top_block.__init__(self)
      
      # Create signal source
      self.source = blocks.file_source(gr.sizeof_gr_complex, "fm_signal.dat")
      
      # FM demodulator
      self.demod = analog.wfm_rcv(
          quad_rate=240000,
          audio_decimation=5
      )
      
      # Audio output
      self.audio_sink = audio.sink(48000)
      
      # Connect blocks
      self.connect(self.source, self.demod, self.audio_sink)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  tb = fm_receiver()
  tb.run()
\`\`\`

### SDR#
A popular program for Windows with a simple interface.

### GQRX
A cross-platform SDR receiver based on GNU Radio.

## First Experiments

### 1. Receiving FM Radio Stations
The easiest way to start with SDR.

### 2. Decoding ADS-B
Tracking aircraft using transponder signals.

### 3. Receiving Weather Satellites
Obtaining images from NOAA weather satellites.

### 4. Spectrum Analysis
Exploring the radio frequency spectrum in your area.

## Conclusion

SDR opens up endless possibilities for experimentation in radio engineering. Start with a simple RTL-SDR device and gradually explore more complex aspects of Software Defined Radio.
