MMANA-GAL is a powerful antenna modeling software based on the method of moments. It allows you to analyze antenna characteristics even before their physical implementation.

## Installation and Setup

MMANA-GAL is available for free and runs on Windows. For correct operation, it is recommended to install all necessary libraries.

## Creating a Dipole Model

### Step 1: Defining Geometry

\`\`\`
Frequency: 14.2 MHz (20m band)
Wire length: 10.1 m (Î»/2)
Wire diameter: 2 mm
Height above ground: 10 m
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Entering Coordinates

For a horizontal dipole:
- Start Point: (-5.05, 0, 10)
- End Point: (5.05, 0, 10)

## Analyzing Results

### Radiation Pattern
The program plots radiation patterns in horizontal and vertical planes.

### SWR and Input Impedance
Analysis of antenna matching with a 50 Ohm feeder.

### Gain
Calculation of gain relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi).

## Optimizing a Yagi Antenna

### Parameters for Optimization:
- Reflector length
- Director lengths
- Spacing between elements
- Element diameter

### Target Characteristics:
- Maximum gain
- Minimum SWR
- Suppression of back lobes

## Practical Tips

1. **Consider Ground Effects**: Always model the antenna taking into account the actual suspension height.
2. **Conductor Material**: Use realistic conductivity parameters.
3. **Segmentation**: Choose the correct number of segments for calculation accuracy.

## Conclusion

MMANA-GAL is an indispensable tool for radio amateurs involved in antenna design. Proper modeling saves time and materials when creating effective antenna systems.
